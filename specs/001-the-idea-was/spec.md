# Feature Specification: Script-to-CLI TUI System

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-idea-was`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The idea was to have a TUI (Terminal UI) that could enable developers to write their own CLI without worrying about writing the actual CLI. This way, developers can focus on writing their usual shell scripts (or Python scripts) and pick it up in the CLI.

Essentially, you should have a dedicated directory organized in a structured hierarchy of folders and scripts to hold all the necessary bash scripts.

Then the CLI picks up the scripts in the folders you choose and incorporates them into the CLI. This means that each script becomes a command that you can run from within the CLI. Once the scripts are detected, they are registered as commands in the CLI. This involves mapping each script to a corresponding command invoked from the CLI.

When you navigate through the CLI and select a specific script, the script is executed. This is done by invoking the underlying script file and capturing its output. The CLI gives developers an accessible way to run their scripts. They just need to add their script to a folder; voila, it's ready to use using the CLI.

Now the developer can focus on what is really important: developing their new features and not maintain [how to add/update various CLIs to use]

This reduced our time planning new features because we knew the usual overhead was gone."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   - If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   - Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   - Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   - If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   - Each requirement must be testable
   - Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   - If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   - If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
-  Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
-  Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to organize my scripts in a directory structure and have them automatically available as commands in a Terminal UI, so that I can focus on writing scripts instead of maintaining CLI infrastructure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a directory with organized shell/Python scripts, **When** I launch the TUI CLI, **Then** I see all my scripts listed as navigable commands
2. **Given** I add a new script to my designated script directory, **When** I refresh or restart the TUI, **Then** the new script appears as a new command option
3. **Given** I navigate to a specific script in the TUI, **When** I select/execute it, **Then** the script runs and I see its output within the TUI interface
4. **Given** I organize scripts in a folder hierarchy, **When** I browse the TUI, **Then** I can navigate through the folder structure to find and execute scripts
5. **Given** I have both shell scripts and Python scripts in my directory, **When** I use the TUI, **Then** both script types are detected and executable

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a script has execution permission issues?
- How does the system handle scripts that require interactive input?
- What occurs when a script has long execution times?
- How are script errors and failures displayed to the user?
- What happens when the script directory structure changes while the TUI is running?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically discover scripts in a configured directory structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both shell scripts and Python scripts as executable commands
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a Terminal User Interface for script navigation and selection
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve the hierarchical folder structure when displaying scripts in the TUI
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute selected scripts and capture their output for display
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to configure which directories to scan for scripts
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh script listings when directory contents change via manual refresh mechanism
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle script execution errors gracefully and display meaningful error messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST support basic script execution without argument passing (argument support to be added in future iterations)
- **FR-010**: System MUST execute scripts using the current user's permissions without additional authentication
- **FR-011**: System MUST support both interactive mode (TUI navigation) and non-interactive mode (direct script execution)
- **FR-012**: System MUST render the TUI responsively based on terminal window size and adapt to window resize events
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a clean, minimal UI design suitable for daily developer use without excessive icons or visual noise
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide an easy installation mechanism and simple update process for regular maintenance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Script**: Represents an executable file (shell/Python) with metadata like name, path, permissions, and execution status
- **Directory Structure**: Represents the hierarchical organization of scripts, maintaining parent-child relationships between folders
- **Command Mapping**: Represents the association between a discovered script and its corresponding CLI command interface
- **Execution Session**: Represents a single script execution instance with input, output, error state, and duration
- **Configuration**: Represents user settings including watched directories, script type preferences, and TUI display options
