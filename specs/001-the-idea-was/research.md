# Phase 0: Research Findings

## Technical Decisions Summary

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from Technical Context have been resolved through comprehensive research.

## 1. Framework Architecture: Bubble Tea + Lip Gloss

**Decision**: Use Bubble Tea framework with hierarchical model tree architecture and Lip Gloss for styling

**Rationale**:
- Production-ready TUI framework with excellent performance optimizations
- Built-in responsive layout system with WindowSizeMsg
- CSS-like styling with Lip Gloss integration
- Strong ecosystem and community support (Microsoft, GitHub use it)

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Root model acts as message router and screen compositor
- Child models handle specific functionality (script browser, executor, config)
- State isolation with message-driven communication
- Focus management system for component navigation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- tcell/tview (rejected due to less Go-idiomatic patterns)
- termui (rejected due to limited layout capabilities)
- Custom terminal library (rejected due to complexity)

## 2. Script Discovery and Execution

**Decision**: Use `exec.CommandContext` with cross-platform shell detection and streaming output

**Rationale**:
- Consistent cross-platform behavior without shell expansion vulnerabilities
- Context support enables proper cancellation and timeout handling
- Real-time output streaming essential for developer experience
- Proper integration with Bubble Tea's command system

**Implementation Pattern**:
```go
// Cross-platform shell detection
func detectShell() string {
    if runtime.GOOS == "windows" { return "cmd" }
    for _, shell := range []string{"/bin/bash", "/bin/sh"} {
        if _, err := os.Stat(shell); err == nil { return shell }
    }
    return "/bin/sh"
}

// Streaming execution with context
func executeScript(ctx context.Context, scriptPath string) tea.Cmd {
    return func() tea.Msg {
        cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, detectShell(), scriptPath)
        cmd.WaitDelay = 5 * time.Second // Cleanup timeout
        return streamOutput(cmd)
    }
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous execution (rejected for poor UX)
- External terminal spawning (rejected as breaks TUI experience)
- os/exec without context (rejected for lack of cancellation)

## 3. Configuration Management

**Decision**: Viper + Cobra with YAML primary format and environment variable support

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard with proven production use
- YAML provides best readability for developer tools
- Multiple configuration locations with proper hierarchy
- Environment variable integration essential for CLI tools

**Configuration Hierarchy**:
1. CLI flags (highest priority)
2. Environment variables (ALEC_ prefix)
3. Configuration file (~/.config/alec/alec.yaml)
4. Defaults (lowest priority)

**Key Configuration Options**:
- `script_dirs`: List of directories to scan
- `timeout`: Script execution timeout
- `max_output_lines`: Output buffer limit
- `extensions`: Supported script type mappings

**Alternatives Considered**:
- TOML format (rejected for less readability)
- JSON format (rejected for lack of comments)
- Custom config format (rejected for unnecessary complexity)

## 4. File System Operations

**Decision**: Use Go 1.21+ filepath.WalkDir with filepath.IsLocal for secure path handling

**Rationale**:
- WalkDir provides better performance than filepath.Walk
- IsLocal prevents path traversal attacks
- Built-in security features in modern Go versions
- Efficient handling of large directory structures

**Security Measures**:
- Path traversal prevention using filepath.IsLocal
- Directory restriction enforcement
- File extension validation
- Script permission verification

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Concurrent directory scanning with worker pools
- Efficient tree building with proper data structures
- Caching of directory metadata

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ioutil functions (rejected as deprecated)
- Manual path validation (rejected for security risks)
- Third-party file walking libraries (rejected as unnecessary)

## 5. Navigation and Tree Display

**Decision**: Use github.com/Digital-Shane/treeview with custom navigation state

**Rationale**:
- Specialized TreeView library with Bubble Tea integration
- Filesystem-aware tree building
- Built-in search and filtering capabilities
- Proper keyboard navigation patterns

**Navigation Features**:
- Hierarchical directory browsing
- Breadcrumb navigation for context
- Search with real-time filtering
- Focus management between components
- Keyboard shortcuts (/, Enter, Escape, Tab)

**Tree Structure**:
```go
type ScriptNode struct {
    Path        string
    IsDirectory bool
    Scripts     []ScriptInfo
    Children    []*ScriptNode
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom tree implementation (rejected due to complexity)
- Flat list with indentation (rejected for poor scalability)
- Third-party file managers (rejected for over-engineering)

## 6. User Interface Design

**Decision**: Clean, minimal design with responsive layouts using Lip Gloss

**Rationale**:
- Developer-focused tool requires productivity over aesthetics
- Responsive design essential for various terminal sizes
- Golden ratio layouts (38% sidebar, 62% main) for optimal space usage
- Consistent styling system with theme support

**Layout Architecture**:
```
┌─ Header (Title, Status) ─────────────────────┐
├─ Sidebar (Tree) ─┬─ Main (Content) ─────────┤
│   Script Tree    │   Selected Script Info   │
│   Navigation     │   or                     │
│                  │   Execution Output       │
└─ Footer (Help, Status) ─────────────────────┘
```

**Design Principles**:
- Golden ratio for sidebar proportions
- Dynamic sizing based on terminal dimensions
- Clear focus indicators and state feedback
- Minimal use of colors and decorative elements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Complex multi-pane layouts (rejected for complexity)
- Full-screen modals (rejected for context loss)
- Rich styling with many colors (rejected for visual noise)

## 7. Performance and Responsiveness

**Decision**: Leverage Bubble Tea's built-in optimizations with smart caching

**Rationale**:
- Framework provides framerate-based rendering
- Diff-based updates minimize terminal I/O
- Command batching prevents UI blocking
- Smart caching reduces expensive operations

**Performance Patterns**:
- Batch multiple commands with `tea.Batch()`
- Cache expensive layout calculations
- Early returns for uninitialized state
- Efficient view composition with string builders

**Target Performance**:
- Sub-100ms script discovery
- <16ms UI updates for responsive feel
- Support for hundreds of scripts
- Graceful degradation with large outputs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual rendering optimization (rejected as framework handles this)
- Custom diffing algorithm (rejected as unnecessary)
- Aggressive caching (rejected for memory concerns)

## 8. Error Handling and Logging

**Decision**: Structured error handling with exit code capture and logging

**Rationale**:
- Exit codes provide valuable debugging information
- Different error types require different UI treatment
- Structured logging essential for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation for script failures

**Error Categories**:
- Execution errors (exit codes, timeouts)
- Permission errors (file access, script execution)
- Configuration errors (invalid paths, malformed config)
- System errors (terminal size, process limits)

**Logging Strategy**:
- Development: Debug logs to stderr
- Production: Error logs to file
- User feedback: Clear error messages in UI
- Metrics: Execution times and success rates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple error strings (rejected for lack of context)
- External logging service (rejected for dependency)
- No error categorization (rejected for poor UX)
